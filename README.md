👋 Hello there, welcome to @parallel-dev-ecm. My name is Emilio and I am a 23-year-old software engineer with a specialization in Python and JavaScript. I have a passion for coding and love to work on projects that push me to learn new things.

I've Been coding since I was a teenager and have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities and challenges that software development has to offer. I have experience working on a wide range of projects, from web development to data science, and machine learning models. ⚛️ 

 I am a self-taught developer and I've been able to develop a deep understanding of Python in data science and machine learning models, using different libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, altair, plotly, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. In Javascript, I have expertise in Three.js, React, R3F, and I am also familiar with Google Firebase and AWS.

👨‍💻 In addition to my work as a software engineer, I am also a professor at CENTRO University in Ciudad de Mexico, where I teach databases patterns and design, and Python, where the class focuses on data visualization, data manipulation, cleaning data, and different unsupervised & supervised Machine Learning models( Classification, Regression, Clustering ). This allows me to stay up to date with the latest developments in the field and share my knowledge with others.

In my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and continue learning about the latest trends in the software development industry. I also enjoy playing video games, lifting, and hanging out with my friends.
