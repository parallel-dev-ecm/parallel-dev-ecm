üëã Hello there, welcome to @parallel-dev-ecm. My name is Emilio and I am a 23-year-old self-taught software engineer with a specialization in Python and JavaScript. I have a passion for coding and love to work on projects that push me to learn new things.

I have been coding since I was a teenager and have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities that software development has to offer. I have experience working on a wide range of projects, from web development to data science, machine learning models, and cloud computing. ‚öõÔ∏è 

 I am a self-taught developer, I have taught myself Python and Javascript, and I have been able to develop a deep understanding of the languages, frameworks and tools. My main expertise in Python is in data science and machine learning models, I have experience working with libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. In Javascript, I have expertise in Three.js, React, R3F, and I am also familiar with Google Firebase and AWS.

I am a fast learner and always looking for new challenges to improve my skills. I am also a team player and enjoy collaborating with others to create great software.

üë®‚Äçüíª In addition to my work as a software engineer, I am also a professor at CENTRO University in Ciudad de Mexico, where I teach data science using Python. This allows me to stay up to date with the latest developments in the field and share my knowledge with others.

In my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and continue learning about the latest trends in the software development industry. I also enjoy playing video games, lifting, and hanging out with my friends.
